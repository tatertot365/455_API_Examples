MODEL CREATION
1) Create a new file called model.py (touch model.py)
2) Import pandas, numpy, and sklearn.linear_model (import pandas as pd, import numpy as np, from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression)
3) read in insurance file and create basic linear regression model
4) Save the model using pickle (import pickle, with open('sample_model.pkl', 'wb') as model_file: pickle.dump(model, model_file))

#### Alternate Method
- I also created a model and exported it to an .onnx file while is used more commonly in C# applications
